### What is your project all about?
- Our project is about creating an e-commerce platform specifically designed for both pet shop owners and pet owners in Nepal.
- The platform aims to provide a centralized marketplace where pet shop owners can sell their products and services.
- This will offer convenience to pet owners in Nepal by enabling them to easily purchase pet-related items and services from a single online platform.

### Why are you doing this project?
#### Addressing a market gap
- We are trying to address the market gap where there is an absence of a centralized platform where pet shop owners can sell their products. 
#### Convenience for pet owners
- We are trying to make it more simplified for pet owners to find and buy pet goodies, saving time and effort for pets.

### What is your vision for the project?
- We are planning to create a platform like an E-mart where all the pet shop owners of Nepal can sell their products and services in one place.
- This will be convenient and easy for all the pet owners here in Nepal to purchase goodies for their pets.

### Programming Languages and Frameworks used
- We used an appropriate version of Python, and Javascript, along with compatible frameworks like Django. Likewise, we utilized the latest stable versions of front-end frameworks, such as HTML and CSS, 
to enhance user interactivity and responsiveness.

### Database Management System (DBMS)
- We used reliable and scalable DBMS, like PostgreSQL v16.
